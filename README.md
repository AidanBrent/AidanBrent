# About Me

Hi, I'm Aidan Brent, a Junior Android Developer with a focus on the Kotlin Language.

Growing up, I always had a proclivity for computers and technology. This extended into High School where I studied Information Technology, learning the Delphi programming language aswell as SQL. Post school, I took courses on Web Design using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

While my career at the time was in In-Person Sales, I kept working on improving my programming skills and eventually used them to assist my employer at the time by helping develop a Web Storefront during the Covid lockdown and beyond, to continue selling their products in a time of uncertainty. This also entailed developing software to integrate the website with their existing POS systems. Software which they are still using to this day.

By doing this I came to realize that my passion truly lied with programming, and have focussed on improving my skills since. I've focused on Android and Kotlin as I've seen the potential that the language and platform brings, while still being consice and modern.
